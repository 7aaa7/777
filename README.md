* In computer science, an *object* can be a variable, a data structure, a function, or a method, and as such, is a value in memory referenced by an identifier.

* *Data* are characteristics or information, usually *numerical*, that are collected through observation. In a more technical sense, data is a set of values of qualitative or quantitative variables about one or more persons or objects, while a datum (singular of data) is a single value of a single variable
* In computer science, data that has several parts, known as a record, can be divided into *fields*. Relational databases arrange data as sets of database records,so called rows. Each record consists of several fields; the fields of all records form the columns. Examples of fields: name, gender, hair colour.
* A *method* in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a procedure associated with a message and an object. An object consists of data and behavior. The data and behavior comprise an interface, which specifies how the object may be utilized by any of various consumers of the object.
* *Object-oriented programming* (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).
